        My name is Devin Thompsonn and I am currently a junior at Syracuse University. I am dually enrolled in the Martin J. Whitman School of Management and the iSchool, studying business analytics and data analytics. I am interested in analyzing data related to business decisions and consumer trends. I am skilled in RStudio, Python, SQL and in the process of adding Power BI soon. I have an internship at National Grid in Syracuse this summer as an IT & Data Analyst intern on the Process and Performance Improvement team. I am set to graduate a semester early, in December 2023. Outside of school, I enjoy going to concerts and travelling. I hang out with friends any chance I get and like to keep a solid professional-personal life balance.
