    All of these sorries I don’t owe you honey
    All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew

    Wasted on you”

        ‘Cause I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
        When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
        But that ain’t you and me so I guess I’ll see you around
        ‘Cause I can’t love you more than my hometown”

That all those prayers you thought you wasted on me
Must’ve finally made their way on through
I thought you should know
I got me a new girl down there in Jefferson City, and

Yeah, I’m still proud of where I came from
Still your only damn son
Can you believe I’m on the radio?
Just thought you should know, thought you should know, thought you should know”

    If you find yourself thinkin’
    About that boy from East Tennessee
    And I know we both knew better
    But we still said forever
    And that was seven summers of Coke
    And Southern Comfort
    Were we dumb or just younger, who knows?
    Back then you used to love the river
    And sippin’ on a sixer with me
    Does it ever make you said to know
    That was seven summers ago?”
